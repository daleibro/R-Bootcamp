```

## Introduction to the Analysis

### Selection of the Dataset

### Goals of the Analysis

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Data Exploration

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
